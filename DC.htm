    <p>Climate change, urban pressure and lack of disaster preparedness, are increasingly transforming natural hazards, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or tsunamis into disastrous events causing life and economic losses. The risk of disasters caused by natural hazards is rising.
    </p>
    <p><b>Disaster Risk Reduction</b> is increasing in the agenda of the Organisations of the UN System. While the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is the roadmap for Disaster Risk Reduction, other global agendas including the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Climate Agreement, the New Urban Agenda and the Biodiversity Agenda have targets that cannot be attained without considering Disaster Risk Reduction.
    </p>
    <p><b>Disaster Risk Reduction</b> is a systematic approach to identifying, assessing and reducing the risks of disaster. It aims to reduce socio-economic vulnerabilities to disaster as well as dealing with the environmental and other hazards that trigger them.

  <div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="why">
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Why is Disaster Risk Reduction important?</h3>
    <p>Natural hazards are naturally-occurring physical phenomena caused by either the rapid or slow onset of events having atmospheric, geologic and hydrologic origins on solar, global, regional, national or local scales. Disasters often follow natural hazards and they are a result of the combination of hazards, the conditions of vulnerability and of the insufficient capacity or measures to reduce the potentially negative consequences of the hazard.

    <p>Our study aims to improve our understanding of potentially unwanted effects of measures that reduce the impacts of disasters across different hazards.An improved understanding of these hazards can help policy makers enforce measures that decrease the overall risk. Traditionally, those measures are aimed at decreasing the risk a building faces of a single hazard type despite their potential of having unwanted effects on other hazard types. For example, building on stilts is an often-used measure to decrease a building's flood vulnerability, however, it simultaneously increases a building's earthquake vulnerability. However, in many countries the built environment faces the threat of different hazard types. A case study of Afghanistan is presented in which the hazard types of flood and earthquake building-level measures are assessed.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Prevention</h3>
    <p>Disaster Risk Reduction involves activities related to:
    </p>
    <p>1. <b>Mitigation</b>
    <p>The lessening or limitation of the adverse impacts of hazards and related disasters. For instance, constructing flood defences, planting trees to stabilize slopes and implementing strict land use and building construction codes.
    <br>
    <br>2. <b>Preparedness</b>
    <p>The knowledge and capacities of governments, professional response and recovery organisations, communities and individuals to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from the impacts of likely, imminent or current hazard events or conditions. For instance, installing early warning systems, identifying evacuation routes and preparing emergency supplies.
    <br>
    <br>3. <b>Response</b>
    <p>Actions taken directly before, during or immediately after a disaster in order to save lives, reduce health impacts, ensure public safety and meet the basic subsistence needs of the people affected.
    <br>
    <br>4. <b>Recovery</b>
    <p>The restoring or improving of livelihoods and health, as well as economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets, systems and activities, of a disaster-affected community or society, aligning with the principles of sustainable development and “build back better”, to avoid or reduce future disaster risk.

    <p>Implementation of these activities and measures is rarely done in isolation and includes a number of associated activities, including:
    <p>•  Identification and measuring disaster risk
    <p>• Education and knowledge development
    <p>• Informing people about their risk (awareness raising)
    <p>• Incorporating DRM into national planning and investment
    <p>• Strengthening institutional and legislative arrangements
    <p>• Providing financial protection for people and businesses at risk (finance and contingency planning)
    <p>• Integrating DRR across multiple sectors, including health, environment, etc.
    <p>Activities for reducing risk can be described as structural, for instance land use planning and implementation of building codes, and non-structural, for instance awareness raising, policy-making and legislation. How governments, civil society and other actors organise DRM, for example through institutional arrangements, legislation and decentralisation, and mechanisms for participation and accountability is termed risk governance. There is clear evidence to suggest that low-income countries with weak governance are more vulnerable and less resilient to disaster risk.
